**Description:**
The code is the MATLAB code for the aissigned question to generate UNRZ signal 
for a given input bit stream and then further convert them to MLT-3 line 
encoding. The MATLAB code has been designed in such a way that the parameter 
that are used by the line encoding can be changed by the user and cand be used 
to modify the output signal form. The parameters are then used to modify the 
signal and find out the difference between the two output signal encoding. The 
first part of the code is used to design the base model of the line encoding 
using variables as the signal parameters and also the singanl patterns. The 
second part of the code is used to plot the graph using plot and line functions
using the same variables used in the functions created before.

**Running the Code:**
The code can be compiled using a MATLAB compiler that has all the prerequistes
libraries installed and the plot can be generated by user giving some input of 
n bitstream and choosing the parameter the user would like to differ.

Just run main.m in command line of MATLAB or use 'Run' button on the menu bar.
